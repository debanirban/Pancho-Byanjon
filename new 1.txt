Here is a fantastic way to earn money using Facebook.

There are many networks – like

NextSoup , 
http://Bigloop.com . 
SocialStar - Social Influencer Advertising   

That pay you money for posting their URLs on your FB page (on per click basis). It means that if you share their URLs on your page, they will pay you for each click on the URL you share.

These networks only let you register on their website if your Facebook page has at least 5,000 to 10,000 followers.

You can easily earn Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 per month by investing just 1-2 hours a day online through this method.

Pay Per Click (PPC) on Your Page: As my friends mentioned, there are many companies that pay you money to be able to post their content on your page. If you have an active social media page or blog, you can make money on just letting them use it. Viral9.com and Nextsoup.com are two sites that pay you on per click basis. Viral9 pays about $6 for 1,000 clicks on an average.
